# freezing_branch
This MATLAB code simulates freeze induced cell dehydration, pressure and diameter changes in a tree stem. \
This directory contains different sub-directories that correspond to different simulations. \
Each sub-directory contains three .m files: main.m, parameters.m and dyfun.m (see explanation below), as well as data (e.g., pressure and temperature fields, ...) produced by the simulations. \
The main directory contains experimental data, and two .m files : comparison.m and post_process.m.
